I have utilized the three.js library of JavaScript in my 6th semester to create numerous projects, including 3D scenes and event-driven projects. Additionally, I have implemented various examples from the book "Computer Graphics" authored by F.S. Hill.

Three.js is a powerful and popular JavaScript library used for creating and displaying 3D graphics in web browsers. It provides a wide range of tools and functionalities that simplify the process of working with 3D elements, making it easier to develop interactive and visually appealing projects.

Using three.js, I have delved into the world of 3D scenes, constructing immersive environments with realistic lighting, textures, and animations. By leveraging the library's features, I have been able to create visually stunning scenes that engage users and provide an interactive experience.

Furthermore, I have explored the concept of event-driven programming with three.js. By utilizing event listeners and handlers, I have developed projects where user interactions trigger specific actions or animations within the 3D environment. This allows for dynamic and responsive experiences, making the projects more engaging and interactive.

In addition to my own creations, I have drawn inspiration from the book "Computer Graphics" by F.S. Hill. This influential book serves as a valuable resource for understanding the fundamental principles and techniques behind computer graphics. By implementing examples from the book using three.js, I have been able to further enhance my understanding and skills in the field of computer graphics.

Overall, through the utilization of the three.js library, I have been able to create diverse projects ranging from 3D scenes to event-driven applications. The incorporation of examples from "Computer Graphics" by F.S. Hill has contributed to my knowledge and expertise, allowing me to develop visually appealing and interactive experiences in the realm of computer graphics.
